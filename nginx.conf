# ============================================================
# NGINX config for serving a single-page app (e.g., Vue/React)
# - Serves static assets from /usr/share/nginx/html
# - SPA history fallback to /index.html
# - Lightweight /healthz for container healthchecks
# - Static asset caching (tweak as needed)
# ============================================================

  # [CHANGE ME] If you run behind a reverse proxy or need HTTPS,
  # you will likely have a separate 443 server block with TLS.
  listen 80;
  # [CHANGE ME] Replace "_" with your domain(s), e.g. example.com www.example.com
